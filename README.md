# mean-demo-1
Demo project using MEAN stack.


## Lesson 1

From the command line navigate to this folder and run:
1. npm install
2. bower install

Have MongoDB running:
mongod
THEN run the app.

Maybe you'll need to install nodemon:
npm install -g nodemon

In the server folder run:
- nodemon app
OR
- nodemon app.js

And navigate to http://localhost:9000
